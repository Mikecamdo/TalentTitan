# TalentTitan

Do before 2/21:

- Fix colors (white + 1 other color, a minimalistic approach)
- Set up different page views (at least on the frontend)
- Look for React Components/Templates and/or fancy CSS that we can use
- Complete the Landing Page
- Have all frontend functionality complete (i.e., search bar works properly, username restrictions (such as needing to be a certain number of characters) are applied, etc.)
